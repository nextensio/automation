This is how okta is configured

0. Custom domain set to login.nextensio.net - need to upload certificate and key and needs to 
   reupload it I guess when larry renews it. Read about custom domain settings for okta, google for it

1. The "default" authorization server is used (Security-->API)
    scopes - openid, profile, email, address, phone, offline_access

    claims:
    a) name "sub" - (appuser != null) ? appuser.userName : app.clientId (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "userType" - user.userType (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "userType" - user.userType (scopes Any, type Id, Included Always)
    a) name "tenant" - user.organization (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "tenant" - user.organization (scopes Any, type Id, Included Always)

    Obviously the profile values for each user has a userType which says "regular", "admin" or "superadmin"
    as seen in controller code. The "tenant" field in profile identifies the nextensio tenant the the user is part of

2. There is a "Nextensio Agent Mobile" app, use PKCE (for public clients), Application Type is "native",
