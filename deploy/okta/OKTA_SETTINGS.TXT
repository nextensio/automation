This is how okta is configured

0. Custom domain set to login.nextensio.net - need to upload certificate and key and needs to 
   reupload it I guess when larry renews it. Read about custom domain settings for okta, google for it

1. The "default" authorization server is used (Security-->API)
    scopes - openid, profile, email, address, phone, offline_access

    claims:
    a) name "sub" - (appuser != null) ? appuser.userName : app.clientId (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "userType" - user.userType (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "userType" - user.userType (scopes Any, type Id, Included Always)
    a) name "tenant" - user.organization (scopes Any, type Access, Included Always)
    a) name "tenant" - user.organization (scopes Any, type Id, Included Always)

    Obviously the profile values for each user has a userType which says "regular", "admin" or "superadmin"
    as seen in controller code. The "tenant" field in profile identifies the nextensio tenant the the user is part of

2. There is a "NextensioAgent" app, use PKCE (for public clients), application type is SPA (Single Page App),
   Grant Type client-on-behalf-of-user,, authorization code+refresh token, refresh token behaviour - 
   rotate token after every use with 30 sec grace (why different from above???),
   user consent - require consent, Signon has custom url, 
   signin url - http://localhost:8180/ AND io.nextensio.agent1:/callback AND nextensio.agent:/login AND https://controller.nextensio.net/login/callback
   signout url - http://localhost:8180 AND io.nextensio.agent1:/callback AND nextensio.agent:/logout AND https://controller.nextensio.net
   login initiated by - App only,
   Initiate login URI - http://localhost:8180/

   NOTE: The client_id of this APP needs to be entered in the "Client ID" tab in the UI (home page logged in as superadmin).
   If by mistake someone deletes this app in okta, no worries, just create an app again as mentioned above and
   update the new client_id in the controller UI
